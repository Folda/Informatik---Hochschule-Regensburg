%\section{20.04.2009}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item higher capacity (The higher capacity. - The times greater capacity.)
%\item 51\%
%\item They can securely disposed with simple tools (Standard DVDs cannot be disposed of easily, and sensitive data can be retrieved from discs which people throw away.)
%\item In the near future (THis is not known. - This has not been announced yet.)
%\item They use a blue laser instead of a red one (Paper discs will use blue laser technology, where current conventional DVDs use red laser.)
%\item 25GB
%\item 4.7GB
%\item Because paper discs cannot hold an substrate which is needed by the red laser technology. (Red laser light needs to pass through a substrate to read and write data. Paper cannot easily bond with a substrate. Red laser light would set fire to the paper.)
%\item They are cheaper in production because of the missing substrate and the cheapness of paper. (They can be produced more cheaply.)
%\item They they say that they don't know what the practical uses could be. (They say they don't know.)
%\end{enumerate}

%\chapter{Hard drive speed limit is reached}
%\section{Vocabulary}
%\section{Questions}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item It is not very practical.\\
%		Because the writing speed in practice depends in many more details/factors such as the speed of the movement of the positioning arm.\\
%		Because present computers are far away from working with electrons shot at the speed of light.
%
%\item They flip a bit faster than current materials.\\
%		Because the properties of exotic materials could possibly allow higher speeds.
%
%\item Changing the magnetic charge.\\
%		To change the bit to the opposite state.\\
%		The state of a bit changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa.
%
%\item So they do not blank a hole part of the disk.\\
%		Because a long-lived pulse would affect neighbouring bits.\\
%		So that the bits are not blocked from further change.
%
%\item To accelerate materials.\\
%		Accelerate charged/subatomic particles to a high speed.
%
%\item The effect is to small to affect the material.\\
%		There is an effect but it is not reliable enough to use this in hard-disk production.
%\end{enumerate}

%\item Ka
%\item Ke
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The runtime is too short.\\
		The runtime of laptop batteries is too short.\\
		The limited runtime of the batteries.

\item NEC\\
		A Japanese concern called NEC.

\item Using fuel cells which can run up to 5 hours.\\
		A fuel cell. Its performance is five hours.\\
		A fuel cell that has/with a runtime of 5 hours.

\item methanol, several ounces\\
		300cc of methanol.

\item They use a catalyst to separate electrons and protons which leads to an electrical charge.\\
		By a catalytic reaction which yields heat and power.\\
		A catalyst assists the breakdown of methanol into oxygen and hydrogen which generates/yields heat and power.

\item It is heavier than normal batteries.\\
		The weight of the laptop increases by 2kg.

\item They will run up to 40 hours.\\
		A runtime for the fuel cell of about 40 hours.

\item They are cramping more batteries into the devices.\\
		They are trying to reduce the power needed/consumed by hardware.\\
		They have build more power efficient components for computers.

\item They believe they have already reached the limit of power efficiency.
\item Mobile phones/Cell Phones.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The access time is} the time between the receipt of instructions from the processor and the onset of data transfer by the programmer.
\item \textbf{The output buffers} are the data interface between memory and processor.\\
		\textbf{The output buffers} are a part of memory which temporarily stores data until it can be processed.

\item \textbf{A wait state is} a condition in which the processor can do nothing/must remain idle until another component completes an operation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item particles
\item circuits
\item regardless
\item fundamental
\item implies
\item ultimate
\item absurd
\item supplanted
\item bound
\item observed
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Distance doesn't affect the relationship.
\item No
\item Because all his laws state that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.
\item Because it didn't fit in any other law of that time.
\item The reaction speed of the materials which are used in the computer.
\item The usage of light instead of electrons.
\item Because it implies that there is no longer a speed limit.
