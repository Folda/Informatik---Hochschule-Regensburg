\chapter{Intel chips get power boost}
\textit{Every fifth word of the first two paragraphs has been shortened. Complete the words so that the text makes good sense. Each underscore (\_) represents one missing letter.}

Intel has released updated v\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G1}{7} of its Pentium 4 c\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G2}{4} that help desktop machines ha\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G3}{4} their growing role as v\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G4}{4}, sound and image-editing s\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G5}{6}. The Prescott series of P\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G6}{6} 4 chips are tuned to \gap{2}(\ref{item:Page1_FillGaps_G7}) a better job of h\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G8}{7} multimedia as well as a r\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G9}{4} of scientific and engineering a\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G10}{11}. Intel has also given \gap{3}(\ref{item:Page1_FillGaps_G11}) chip more memory and m\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G12}{3} changes to the way \gap{2}(\ref{item:Page1_FillGaps_G13}) handles instructions in an at\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G14}{5} to improve performance. The t\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G15}{9} giant has also modified its m\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G16}{12} methods for the new t\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G17}{3} of chip to help i\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G18}{1} take performance to new l\ugap{item:Page1_FillGaps_G19}{5}.

\item to change an existing thing (to make changes to part of a process, system \ac{etc.} without changing the whole process)
\item to slowly loose things from an containment (unwanted/unintended emission from a closed system)
\item to insert the same amount of something into a smaller place with very few room (to put/push/force more and more items into a small space)
\item an alternative version of something or doing something with some few changes
\item to make something better or faster than previous versions (replace the old version)\\
		\Ra The USB quickly superseded the parallel and RS232 ports
\item to target a group of things (together/as a group)
\item to watch and use something and rate it after specific criteria
\item to not change something over a period of time
\item to make something faster than before (increase)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because the old chips, which were used in desktops, weren't able to handle the amount of data which is used in multimedia applications. (Because image editing and multimedia applications need greater CPU\\$\begin{cases}\text{speed}\\\text{performance}\end{cases}$.)
\item The silicon becomes a better conductor. (The silicon becomes a better conductor\\$\begin{cases}\text{which makes the chip more efficient}\\\text{which increases processing speed}\end{cases}$.)
\item The loss of power. (This can lead to loss of data, processing errors, loss of performance generally and a shorter processor lifespan.)
\item The process is much larger and so has more space for memory. (The decreased width of components from 130nm to 90nm.)
\item There is older software which isn't using the advantage of the new instructions of the processor. (Because current applications have not been designed for the new chips (are not yet compatible with\dots).)
\item It allows the use of new processors with the old chip sets/motherboards. (Intel can produce the new chips without changing the production line, which saves a large amount of money.)
\end{enumerate}
