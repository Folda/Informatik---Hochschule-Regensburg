\section*{How should you write technical documents}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Impersonal
		\begin{itemize}[label=\ra]
		\item Do not use ``I'', do not use ``you''
		\item If a human agent is part of the process, then the function is used e.g. ``the user'', ``the operator'', ``the administrator'', ``the programmer'' etc.
		\end{itemize}

\item High level specialist vocabulary
		\begin{itemize}[label=\ra]
		\item no slang
		\item no ``everyday'' vocabulary where specialist terms are available
		\item technical terms must be repeated if it is not possible to use a pronoun
				\begin{itemize}[label=\Ra]
				\item do not use different words for style reason
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

\item Objective
		\begin{itemize}[label=\ra]
		\item no personal opinions
		\item no emotional language
		\end{itemize}

\item There is much greater use of passive verb structures in specialist texts than in ``everyday'' language.
		\begin{itemize}[label=\ra]
		\item the passive focuses more clearly on what is being described
		\item it avoids overloading the text with superfluous information that distracts the reader from the focus
		\end{itemize}

\item Conventionally, short forms are not used in formal writing - \textbf{No} ``don't, doesn't, isn't'' et cetera. Always use ``do not, does not,'' and so on.
\item The content of the text must be logically structured. The reader must always be able to recognize a thread and follow it.
\item Professional technical texts are \textbf{not} ``Stilaufsätze''
\end{enumerate}
